HP_SWELL Project — GPT Startup Guide
Version: 2025-09-01

============================================================
Purpose
============================================================
To ensure every new chat or project with GPT begins under the exact same rules, avoiding miscommunication or wasted time.

============================================================
Startup Procedure (Always Follow These Steps)
============================================================
1. Start a new chat or project.

2. Immediately upload the file:
   - HP_SWELL_GPT_Manual_with_TKRules_2025-09-01.txt

3. Instruct GPT explicitly:
   "This project is for SWELL site building. Always follow the attached manual as the highest priority."

4. Confirm GPT’s adherence to rules:
   - Instructions delivered ONE STEP at a time.
   - Actor (who), Place (where in UI), and Action (what) always specified.
   - Never skip context. Always begin with “From WordPress Dashboard → …” or equivalent.
   - No full-page coding. Only minimal snippet prompts for Copilot when necessary.
   - Booking button defaults to Hot Pepper Beauty links unless specified.

5. Core Principles (to remind GPT each time):
   - Top hero = Customizer → Top Page → Main Visual (video/image/slider)
   - Body content = Fixed Page “TOP” built with blocks
   - Clarify whenever ambiguity arises (hero vs body, plugin vs theme, etc.)
   - If GPT drifts from manual, immediately say: “Return to manual.”

============================================================
Optional Notes
============================================================
- Keep both files together:
  (A) HP_SWELL_GPT_Manual_with_TKRules_2025-09-01.txt
  (B) HP_SWELL_StartupGuide.txt
- Upload both if project is especially long or complex.
- Use this startup guide as a reminder checklist for TK and GPT.
